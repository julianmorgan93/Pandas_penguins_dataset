# 🐧 Handling Missing Data with Pandas – Palmer Penguins Dataset

This project explores techniques for identifying and handling missing values in real-world datasets using Python and pandas. It includes practical examples with both a sample DataFrame and the penguins.csv dataset from the Palmer Penguins project. Key steps involve detecting missing entries, quantifying them across rows and columns, and applying strategies like dropping or filtering data. Ideal for learners and analysts looking to improve their data cleaning and wrangling skills.


## 🔍 Features

- Analysis of a custom food dataset with missing values
- Exploration of the **Palmer Penguins** dataset (`penguins.csv`)
- Techniques for identifying, counting, and handling null values
- Examples of dropping irrelevant columns and filtering incomplete rows
